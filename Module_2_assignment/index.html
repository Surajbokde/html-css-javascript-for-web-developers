                <h2>Hariprasad Chaurasia</h2>
                <p>
                     A legendary Indian flautist and counted among the greatest masters of the north Indian bamboo flute, Hariprasad Chaurasia is a Padma Shree and a Padma Vibushan recipient. Unlike many Indian musicians who were born in muscial families, Hariprasad Chaurasia was the son of a wrestler. He had to rebel against his father and he secretly began learning classical vocal music at the age of 15 from his neighbor. Upon meeting the famous flautist Pandit Bholanath Prasanna of Varanasi, he was deeply influenced by his music and began learning to play the flute under his guidance.
